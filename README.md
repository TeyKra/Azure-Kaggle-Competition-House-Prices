## Results

This project explores multiple modern machine learning approaches to address a regression problem and compares their effectiveness using the official Kaggle evaluation metric.

### Azure Machine Learning

- **AutoML:**  
  Achieved a **Log-RMSE of 0.15160**, demonstrating the efficiency of automated machine learning for quickly establishing a strong regression baseline.

- **Pipeline Designer:**  
  Achieved a **Log-RMSE of 0.14062**, highlighting the ability of Azure Machine Learning’s visual pipelines to streamline model development while improving performance.

### Notebook (Custom Implementation)

- **Log-RMSE (Kaggle metric):**  
  Achieved the **lowest Log-RMSE of 0.12258** using a fully custom notebook-based approach.  
  This method delivered the best predictive performance, showcasing the flexibility and fine-grained control enabled by coding from scratch.

> **Note:** Lower Log-RMSE values indicate better model performance.

## Conclusion

Using multiple machine learning approaches provided valuable insights into the trade-offs between automation and manual optimization.  
Azure Machine Learning’s AutoML and Pipeline Designer enabled rapid experimentation and delivered competitive results with minimal configuration.  
However, the custom notebook-based implementation achieved the best performance due to its greater flexibility for feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
